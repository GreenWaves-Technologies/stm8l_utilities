# STM8L Utilities


##' S19TOHEADER: Python script for converting STM8L code in S19 format to header file
### STM8L_SOURCECODE: Source code to run on STM8L
### STM8L_PROGRAM: Code for emulating SWIM interface on GAP and programming STM8L
### STM8L_CTRL: Code for controlling STM8L once programmed on the 2-wire custom interface

## KNOWN LIMITATIONS/TO DO:
- Programming is slow - to be improved
- STM8L power consumption with GAP8 on to be improved (implement sleep states)
