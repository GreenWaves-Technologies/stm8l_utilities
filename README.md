# GAPoC B STM8L utility

This utility is meant to programm the STM8L which equips the GAPoC B boards

## List of content:

- S19TOHEADER: Python script for converting STM8L code in S19 format to header file

- STM8L_SOURCECODE: Source code to run on STM8L

- STM8L_PROGRAM: Code for emulating SWIM interface on GAP and programming STM8L

- STM8L_CTRL: Code for controlling STM8L once programmed on the 2-wire custom interface


KNOWN LIMITATIONS/TO DO:
- Programming is slow - to be improved
- STM8L power consumption with GAP8 on to be improved (implement sleep states)
